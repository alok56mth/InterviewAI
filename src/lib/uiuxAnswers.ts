            "What is the difference between UI and UX design?": "UI (User Interface) focuses on visual elements - colors, typography, buttons, layouts. UX (User Experience) focuses on overall experience - how users feel, ease of use, solving problems. UI is how it looks; UX is how it works and feels.",
            "What are the key principles of good UI design?": "Key principles: Clarity (easy to understand), Consistency (same patterns throughout), Feedback (respond to user actions), Efficiency (minimal steps), Accessibility (usable by all), Visual hierarchy (guide user attention), Simplicity (avoid clutter).",
            "What is visual hierarchy and why is it important?": "Visual hierarchy arranges elements to show importance order. Uses size, color, contrast, spacing, typography. Important because it guides users' attention, makes content scannable, improves usability and comprehension.",
            "What is whitespace and how does it improve design?": "Whitespace (negative space) is empty area between elements. Improves readability, reduces cognitive load, creates visual breathing room, groups related elements, makes design feel premium and professional.",

            "What is typography and why does it matter in UI design?": "Typography is the art of arranging text. Matters because it affects readability, establishes hierarchy, conveys brand personality, impacts accessibility. Choose fonts that are legible, appropriate, and consistent.",
            "What is consistency in design and why is it important?": "Consistency means using same patterns, colors, typography, spacing throughout. Important for learnability (users recognize patterns), efficiency (predictable interactions), trust (professional appearance), reduced cognitive load.",
